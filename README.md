# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker
With this project, I was tasked to create an app that tracks daily workouts and exercises.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/WorkoutTracker). The deployed page can be located [here](https://secret-beyond-58160.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
Select "Continue Workout" to add a new exercise to the latest workout day. Or select "New Workout" to create a new workout entry for today and add new exercises to that. In either case, follow the onscreen instructions and fill out the form provided to add your new exercise to your current workout.
Click on the "Fitness Tracker Dashboard" at the top left to view a summary of your daily workouts over the past week.
